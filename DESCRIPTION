Description: Construct message-passing style objects with types and
    features. Q7 types uses composition instead of inheritance in creating
    derived types, allowing definining any code segment as feature and
    associating any feature to any object. Compared to R6, Q7 is simpler,
    more flexible, and more friendly.
